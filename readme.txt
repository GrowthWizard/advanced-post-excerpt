Replace the default Post Excerpt meta box with a superior editing experience.


== Description ==

[WordPress post excerpts](https://codex.wordpress.org/Excerpt) can be a great way to hand-craft the summary of your content. Unfortunately, writing post excerpts isn't as nice of an experience as what you find elsewhere in WordPress. Want to include links in your excerpts, or bold some text? Hopefully you know some HTML!

Advanced Post Excerpts is designed to change that, by giving your editors an easy, intuitive interface for writing great post excerpts.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files into `wp-content/plugins/advanced-post-excerpt`.
2. Activate the plugin through the WordPress "Plugins" screen.


== Screenshots ==
